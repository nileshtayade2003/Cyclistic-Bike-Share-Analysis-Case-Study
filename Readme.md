# 🚴‍♂️ Cyclistic Rider Behavior Analysis Dashboard (Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study)
### *A Google Data Analytics Capstone Project*

This repository contains the full analysis, Power BI dashboard, and final report for the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study.  
The goal of this project is to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use Cyclistic differently and provide insights to help convert casual riders into paying members.

---

##  1. Business Task

Cyclistic aims to increase its annual membership base because annual members generate higher long-term revenue than casual riders.  
The key business question is:

**“How do annual members and casual riders differ in their bike usage behavior, and how can Cyclistic use these insights to improve membership conversions?”**

---

##  2. Data Source

The analysis uses **12 months of Cyclistic (Divvy) bike-share trip data**, publicly available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) under open license from Motivate International Inc.

- Format: CSV files  
- Period: Previous 12 months  
- R million  
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is included  
- Data covers: ride timestamps, bike types, rider type, locations, etc.  


All data was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using **Power BI (Power Query + DAX)**.

##  3. Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Dashboard, modeling, DAX measures  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX** – Measures for KPIs and percentage filters  
- **GitHub** – Project documentation  
- **Microsoft Excel** (initial testing)

---

##  4. Data Preparation (Power Query Steps)

The following cleaning and transformation steps were applied:

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Removed null or missing values  
- Removed invalid records (negative, 0-minute rides)  
- Standardized data types  

### ✅ Feature Engineering
New calculated columns added:

- **ride_length_minutes**  
  `Duration.TotalMinutes([ended_at] - [started_at])`

- **ride_length_bucket**  
  Categorized into:
  `0–5, 6–10, 11–20, 21–30, 31–45, 46–60, 60+ minutes`

- **day_of_week**  
- **month**  
- **weekday_number** (for proper sorting)

These steps prepared the dataset for fast DAX calculations and visualization.

##  5. Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes the following key analyses:

### ✅ KPI Metrics
- Total Rides  
- % Casual Riders  
- % Member Riders  
- Avg Ride Duration (Members vs Casual)

### ✅ Visual Insights
- **Rides by Day of Week** (commute vs leisure patterns)  
- **Monthly Trends** (seasonality analysis)  
- **Ride Duration Buckets** (distribution differences)  
- **Bike Type Usage** (classic vs electric)
